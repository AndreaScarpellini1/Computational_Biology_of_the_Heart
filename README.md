## Project Description

The project involves simulating the effect of a specific drug on cardiac action potentials using MATLAB. It includes various scripts for running simulations, analyzing action potential durations (APD), and visualizing the results through plots.

## Key Features

- **Action Potential Simulation:** Run simulations of cardiac action potentials under different conditions.
- **APD Analysis:** Calculate and analyze the duration of action potentials (APD90).
- **Data Visualization:** Generate plots to visualize AP shapes and statistical analysis of APD.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2020b or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaScarpellini1/Computational_Biology_of_the_Heart.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Computational_Biology_of_the_Heart
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Simulations

To run the simulations:

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
2. Execute the main simulation script:

   ```matlab
   run('main2019_ORd_MMChA.m')
   ```

### Viewing the Results

The simulation will generate various plots and data files that can be viewed directly in MATLAB.

## Results

The results section includes:

- **Action Potential Plots:** Visual representations of the simulated action potentials.
- **APD90 Analysis:** Statistical analysis of the APD90 values under different conditions.
